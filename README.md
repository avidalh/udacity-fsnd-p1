##Project 1: Movie Trailer Website with Fresh Tomatoes </h2>
by Angel Vidal
###About
The project has three python files:
`media.py`: class movie declaration.
`movies.py`: main program file with the instances to the movie class.
`fresh_tomatoes.py`: helper python module for html generating.

To run the program type `python movies.py` from the command line and the web page 
`fresh_tomatoes.html` will be generated and loaded into the browser.

Once the html file is generated you can load it without run the program.

If you need to add more movies to the library insert them into the movies file and run the program
again as described before.
